## ERC20 Token Standard

1- **A token** is designed to represent something of value but also things like voting rights or
discount vouchers. **It can represent any fungible trading good;**

2- **ERC** stands for **Ethereum Request for Comments**. An ERC is a form of proposal and its
purpose is to define standards and practices;

3- **EIP** stands for **Ethereum Improvement Proposal** and makes changes to the actual code
of Ethereum. **ERC is just guidance on how to use different features of Ethereum.**

4- **ERC20** is **a proposal that intends to standardize** how a token contract should be
defined, how we interact with such a token contract and how these contracts interact
with each other.

5- **ERC20 is a standard interface** used by applications such as wallets, decentralized
exchanges, and so on to interact with tokens;

6- We need a token standard for **interoperability**

7- **We use the same wallet** in which we store Ether to buy, sell or transfer a token, but we
are actually interacting with a contract.

8- **A token holder has full control and complete ownership of their tokens.** The tokenâ€™s
contract keeps track of token ownership in the same way the Ethereum network keeps
track of who owns ETH;

9- There are tokens that are fully-ERC20-compliant and tokens that are only
partially-ERC20-compliant;

10- A full compatible **ERC20 Token must implement 6 functions and 2 events.**

11- There are thousands of ERC20 token contracts defined: https://etherscan.io/tokens
