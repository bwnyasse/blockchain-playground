# metamask_connect

How to build a modern web Dapp with Flutter!

We will use :

- the flutter_web3 package for interacting with the Ethereum object

- connecting with Metamask, Wallet Connect, and other providers

## Features : 

- Using the Ethereum object and its method like `requestAccount`.

- Using [Ethers js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) to interact with smart contracts.

- Using default ContractERC20 to construct the contract that has [ERC20 standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).
