# evoting dapp using Ethereum and Smart Contract

A simple Dapp for voting between two values, which are alpha and beta. 
For the scope of this demonstration, we will not be going into any of the complexities such as verifying a user and the number of times a user can vote; we are just going to focus on creating a simple smart contract in Solidity and deploying it within our application using Flutter.

The smart contract source code is [here](https://github.com/bwnyasse/blockchain-playground/tree/main/ethereum/projects/evoting)
